Understanding JST Transcripts

The fall exhibit and description for courses and occupations listed on JST transcripts can be found in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational

Experiences in the Armed Services which is available only online at: (http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/pages/military-guide-online.aspx) and updated
on a daily basis as new courses and occupations are evaluated for recommended credit.
Key to transcript terms:

Military Course ID - This is the number the military service has assigned for this particular course.
SH - Semester hours.

ACE Identifier - The number ACE assigns a particular course. Courses are identified by a 2-letter prefix that designates the military service (AF - Air

Force, AR - Army, CG - Coast Guard, DD - Department of Defense, MC - Marine Corps, and NY - Navy), followed by a unique eight-digit course
identifier.

ACE Credit Recommendation is listed in semester hours, in the following categories:

V = Vocational; L = Lower level (freshman or sophomore level); U = Upper level (Junior or Senior Level); G = Graduate level.

Dates Taken/Dates Held - Courses and occupations will normally have a start and end date that will show the time period the course was completed or
the occupation was held.

Location - Valid location(s) where the course was completed.

Navy Rates and Ratings:

NER - Navy enlisted rates are occupation identifications assigned to personnel at Paygrades E-1 to E-9. Each general rate involves the performance of
entry-level tasks and leads to one or more ratings. Career patterns from recruit to master chief petty officer are identified by 4 to Sdigit codes. ;

by general rates and ratings and that are not rating-wide requirements. Selected NECS have been evaluated by ACE to date. ; ; ;
